# Customer Support Chatbot

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Customer Support Chatbot designed to assist users by answering queries, providing information, and solving common issues. The chatbot is built using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and is capable of understanding and responding to user inputs in a conversational manner.

## Project Structure

### **Chatbot Class:**

- **Initialization:**
  - Sets up the chatbot environment, loads necessary data, and initializes key parameters like response accuracy, user query handling, etc.

- **load_model():**
  - Loads the pre-trained NLP model used to understand and generate responses based on user queries.

- **get_response():**
  - Takes user input, processes it, and returns an appropriate response by consulting the pre-trained model and knowledge base.

- **handle_fallback():**
  - Manages cases where the chatbot is unable to understand the user's query, providing general responses or redirecting to a human agent.

- **update_knowledge_base():**
  - Allows updating the chatbot's knowledge base with new information or FAQs to improve its accuracy over time.

### **Training and Fine-Tuning:**

- **Data Preparation:**
  - Prepares and preprocesses the customer interaction data for training the NLP model.

- **Model Training:**
  - Involves training the NLP model using historical chat data to improve its response accuracy and relevance.

- **Fine-Tuning:**
  - Continuously fine-tunes the chatbot based on user feedback and interaction logs to enhance its performance.

## Requirements

Before running the code, ensure the following dependencies are installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas nltk keras tensorflow
```

## Running the Code

To start the chatbot, run the main script:

```bash
python chatbot.py
```

The chatbot will start interacting with users, processing queries, and providing relevant responses.

## Hyperparameters

- **response_accuracy:** 0.90
- **learning_rate:** 0.001
- **epochs:** 10
- **batch_size:** 32
- **training_data_size:** 10000 samples

## Environment

The chatbot is designed to work in a customer support environment, where it handles the following:

- **User Queries:**
  - Understands and responds to various customer inquiries, such as product information, troubleshooting, and general questions.

- **Knowledge Base:**
  - Consults a pre-built knowledge base to provide accurate answers or escalate complex issues to human agents.

## Future Improvements

- **Integration with CRM Systems:**
  - Linking the chatbot with Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems for personalized responses.

- **Sentiment Analysis:**
  - Incorporating sentiment analysis to gauge customer emotions and tailor responses accordingly.

- **Multi-Language Support:**
  - Expanding the chatbot's capabilities to handle multiple languages.
